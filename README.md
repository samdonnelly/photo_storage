# 'photo_transfer.py'
#
## What it does:
 - Reads images on a camera SD card and sorts them into a 
 local and external drive folder

## Program flow:
1. A folder name and location is specified by the user 
2. The range of the photos are selected (lower and upper 
image number) so the program knows which photos it's working 
with
3. Favourite photos are chosen and moved to a local folder 
for keeping
4. Remaining photos are moved to an identical external drive 
folder once you're done
5. An option is given to run the program again with a new 
range of photos
